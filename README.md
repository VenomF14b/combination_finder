The custom_linear_counter function is designed to implement a custom counter that can handle a variable number of units, where each unit can count from 0 up to a specified maximum value. The purpose is to count sequentially with each unit, and when a unit reaches its maximum value, it resets to 0, and a new unit is added to the count.

Here's a non-technical description of how to use the function:

Inputs:

max_num_units: Provide a list specifying the maximum values each unit can reach.
num_units: Provide a list indicating the current count values for each unit.
count_stopper: Provide a boolean flag to control whether the counting should stop.
Function Behavior:

The function checks if both num_units and max_num_units are provided.
It then handles different cases based on the length of num_units.
Counting Process:

For each unit, if its current value is less than its maximum value, it increments the count.
If a unit reaches its maximum value, it resets to 0, and a new unit is added to the count.
Stopping Condition:

If seven units exist (the function is currently designed for up to seven units), and all units have reached their maximum value, the count_stopper flag is set to True.
Output:

The function returns an updated list of count values for each unit (num_units).
It also returns the count_stopper flag, indicating whether the counting should stop.
Initialization:

If num_units is not provided, the function initializes the count with a single unit starting at 0.
Example Usage:

You might use this function in a scenario where you need to iterate through a sequence of events, and each event is associated with a specific unit. Once all units reach their maximum values, you might want to stop the counting.
Overall, this function provides a flexible way to implement a custom counter with varying units, making it useful for scenarios where a dynamic counting mechanism is required.
