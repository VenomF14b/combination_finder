# combination_finder
The python function is designed to implement a custom counter that can handle a variable number of units, where each unit can count from 0 up to a specified maximum value. The purpose is to count sequentially with each unit, and when a unit reaches its maximum value, it resets to 0, and a new unit is added to the count.
